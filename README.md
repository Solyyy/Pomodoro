# About
This project is based on the Pomodoro Technique, using Graphical User Interface (GUI) and Tkinter module. The goal of this project is to beat procrastination and improve your focus one Pomodoro at a time

# How does the Pomodoro Technique work?

When you start the application and press on start a timer will start a countdown.

After 25 minutes have passed, a new timer will be open to show the message **"Break"**, so it's time for a **Short Break**. It lasts 5 minutes.

Once the short break time is over, another timer will be open telling you it's **"Work"**, and another session of 25 minutes of work will be started.

This process will be repeated 4 times, but the last break, a (Long Break) will last 25 minutes.

More information can be found on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique).
